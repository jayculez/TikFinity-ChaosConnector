ChaosConnector allows you to connect [TikFinity](https://tikfinity.zerody.one/) with [ChaosTricks](https://chaostricks.com/) to do funny things with your favorite games!

## Installation
Download the latest version from the [Release section](https://github.com/zerodytrash/ChaosConnector/releases).

1. Place the ChaosConnector.exe in the ChaosTricks directory.
2. Make sure that ChaosTricks is NOT running
3. Start ChaosConnector.exe - If everything goes smoothly ChaosTricks starts up
4. Sign in with your Twitch account and set up the game integrations.

Now you are ready to send events from TikFinity to ChaosTricks. 
Please keep in mind that ChaosConnector has to run permanently beside 
ChaosTricks in order for everything to work.

If you start ChaosTricks without ChaosConnector, it will not work. 
To undo this, run the unpatch.bat file inside the ChaosTricks folder.
